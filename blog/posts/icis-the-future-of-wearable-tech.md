I've been hearing a lot about the future of technology whether it be on the news, in an article or just in conversation. I title this post *The Future of **Wearable** Tech* because, right now, it's a growing area in the world of technology, but there is still a lot to be developed. In no way will these technologies replace our personal computers (yet?). 

Anyways, about a month ago I stumbled upon a new piece of wearable tech called *Icis* which is currently being developed by a small group in Boston, MA that go by the name [La Forge Optical](http://www.laforgeoptical.com/). The headline to the article I discovered this in had the substring, *Google Glass Competitor*, so I decided to see what it was all about. Having tried Glass before I was interested to see if what these guys were doing would be just a masked copy or something radically different. Right now, it doesn't seem radically different, but definitely different and even a bit more practical than Glass.
